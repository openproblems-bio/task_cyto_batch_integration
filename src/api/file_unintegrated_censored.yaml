#TODO: Change to the required and/or optional fields of the anndata

label: Unintegrated Censored
summary: |
  An unintegrated dataset with certain columns (cells metadata), such as the donor information, hidden.
  These columns are intentionally hidden to prevent bias.
  The batch correction algorithm should not have to rely on these information 
  to properly integrate different batches.
  This dataset is used as the input for the batch correction algorithm. 
  The cells therein are identical to those in the unintegrated dataset.

          Whether the sample the cell came from can be used as a control for batch 
          effect correction.
          0: cannot be used as a control.
          >= 1: can be used as a control.
          For cells with >= 1: cells with the same value come from the same donor.
          Different values indicate different donors.
