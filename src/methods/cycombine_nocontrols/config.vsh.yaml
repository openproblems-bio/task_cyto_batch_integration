description: |
  cyCombine perform batch integration by first using self-organizing maps (SOM) to 
  group similar cells, then applies a ComBat-based method to correct batch effects within 
  each group of similar cells. 
  
  Here, we run cyCombine without control samples (replicates in cyCombine terminology).
