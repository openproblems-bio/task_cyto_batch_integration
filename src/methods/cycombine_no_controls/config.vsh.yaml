summary: "cyCombine without control samples"
description: |
  cyCombine perform batch integration using self-organizing maps and ComBat.
  It first uses self-organizing maps (SOM) to group similar cells into clusters, 
  then applies a ComBat-based method to correct batch effects within 
  each cluster. 
  Here, we run cyCombine without any control samples (replicates in cyCombine terminology) 
  using square SOM grid.
  The size of the SOM grid is varied linearly between value of 6-16, with default set to 8
  following the default value in create_som function in cyCombine.
  Rlen, which is the number of times data is presented to the SOM network and can impact
  clustering quality. 
  It is varied linearly between value of 10-20 with default set to 10.
