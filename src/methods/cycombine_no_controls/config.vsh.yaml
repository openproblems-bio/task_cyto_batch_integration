summary: "cyCombine without control samples"
description: |
  cyCombine perform batch integration using self-organizing maps and ComBat.
  It first uses self-organizing maps (SOM) to group similar cells into clusters, 
  then applies a ComBat-based method to correct batch effects within 
  each cluster. 
  Here, we run cyCombine without any control samples (replicates in cyCombine terminology).
