summary: Batch effect correction using a per‚Äêchannel basis normalization method (gaussNorm)
description: |
  This method batch-normalizes a set of cytometry data samples by identifying and aligning the high density regions (landmarks or peaks) for each channel.
  The data of each channel is shifted in such a way that the identified high density regions are moved to fixed locations called base landmarks.
  Normalization is archived in three phases:
  1. identifying high-density regions (landmarks) for each flowFrame in the flowSet for a single channel
  2. computing the best matching between the landmarks and a set of fixed reference landmarks for each channel called base landmarks
  3. manipulating the data of each channel in such a way that each landmark is moved to its matching base landmark. Please note that this normalization is on a channel-by-channel basis

  NOTE: The default implementation uses `max.lms=2`, although for some channels it is not possible to compute 2 landmarks, resulting in an error.
  In order to fully automate the batch normalization process, this implementations checks whether it is possible to compute 2 landmarks, and if not, it sets `max.lms=1` for that channel.
