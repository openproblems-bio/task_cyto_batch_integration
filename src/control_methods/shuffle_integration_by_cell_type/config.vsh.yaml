label: Shuffle Integration â€” within cell type
summary: Randomly reassign cells to any cell types
description: | 
  This negative-control method randomly permutes cell-to-cell type assignments.
  Cells will be assigned to any cell types, regardless of their original cell type
  or sample of origin or batch of origin.

  Purpose:
  - Evaluate whether an integration method preserves differences between cell types
  while removing batch effects.

  Example:
  - A Neutrophil from a KO sample in batch 1 may be reassigned to any cell type
    (B cell, T cell, Monocyte, etc.) from any sample in any batch.
