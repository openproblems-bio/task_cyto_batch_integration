label: Shuffle Integration
summary: Randomly shuffle cells in the whole dataset.
description: |
  This negative control randomly permutes cell-to-sample (hence batch)
  assignments while keeping each cell's measured markers unchanged. 
  This destroys any biological and batch specific structure but preserves marker expression.

  Purpose:
  - Provide a baseline to verify that integration methods outperform
    random assignment of cells to batches.
  
  Example:
    - A cell from a KO sample in batch 1 may be reassigned to any sample in the whole data.
    It may be reassigned to another KO sample in batch 1 or 2, or to a WT sample in batch 1 or 2.
