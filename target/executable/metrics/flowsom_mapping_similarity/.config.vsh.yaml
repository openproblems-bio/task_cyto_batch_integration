    description: "The metric is based on the FlowSOM algorithm, a popular method which\
      \ uses self-organizing maps for the viasualization/interpretation/clustering\
      \ of cytometry data. \nThe FlowSOM algorithm creates a tree structure that represents\
      \ the relationships between different cell populations in the data.\n\nFor each\
      \ paired sample of technical replicates (where 'split1' are integrated technical\
      \ replicates from split 1 and 'split2' are integrated technical replicates from\
      \ split 2)\n1. A FlowSOM tree is created using cells in the sample from split\
      \ 1.\n2. Cells from the sample in split 2 are mapped onto the FlowSOM tree created\
      \ in step 1.\n3. A similarity measure is computed by comparing cell type proportions\
      \ of 'split2' and 'split1' in each flowsom cluster.\n\nIdeally, the proportions\
      \ of cell types in the flowsom clusters of the paired samples should be similar,\
      \ as they are technical replicates.\n\nThe FlowSOM mapping similarity measure\
      \ can be expressed as follows:\n$\\text{FlowSOM mapping similarity} = 100 -\
      \ \\text{FlowSOM mapping dissimilarity}$\n\nThe $\\text{FlowSOM mapping dissimilarity}$\
      \ is:\n\n$\\text{FlowSOM mapping dissimilarity} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{k}\\sum_{c=1}^{C}\\\
      abs{P^{split1}_{k,c} - P^{split2}_{k,c}}$\n\nWhere:\n- $K$ is the number of\
      \ flowsom clusters\n- $C$ is the number of cell types\n- $w_{k}$ is the weight\
      \ of flowsom cluster $k$. It refers to the number of cells in flowsom cluster\
      \ $k$, divided by the total number of cells in the flowsom tree. Note: the flowsom\
      \ tree contains all the cells of a sample pair (both integrated and validation).\
      \ \n- $P^{split1}_{k,c}$ is the percentage of cell type $c$ in flowsom cluster\
      \ $k$ of the split 1 sample\n- $P^{split2}_{k,c}$ is the percentage of cell\
      \ type $c$ in flowsom cluster $k$ of the split 2 sample\n\nThe average FlowSOM\
      \ mapping similarity among all paired samples is computed and reported as the\
      \ final metric value.\nUnlabelled cells are excluded from the analysis.\n"

  description: "Cytometry is a non-sequencing single cell profiling technique commonly\
    \ used in clinical studies. \nIt is very sensitive to batch effects, which can\
    \ lead to biases in the interpretation of the result. \nBatch integration algorithms\
    \ are often used to mitigate this effect.\n\nIn this project, we are building\
    \ a pipeline for reproducible and continuous benchmarking \nof batch integration\
    \ algorithms for cytometry data.\nAs input, methods require cleaned and normalised\
    \ (using arc-sinh or logicle transformation)\ndata with multiple batches, cell\
    \ type labels, and biological subjects, with paired samples\nfrom a subject profiled\
    \ across multiple batches.\nThe batch integrated output must be an integrated\
    \ marker by cell matrix stored in \nAnndata format.\nAll markers in the input\
    \ data must be returned, regardless of whether they were integrated or not.\n\
    This output is then evaluated using metrics that assess how well the batch effects\n\
    were removed and how much biological signals were preserved. \n"
