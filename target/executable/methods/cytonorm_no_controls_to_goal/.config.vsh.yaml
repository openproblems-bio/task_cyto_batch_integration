description: "CytoNorm corrects batch effects by using reference control samples (aliquots\
  \ of one sample, \ntechnical replicates) included with each batch. \nIt clusters\
  \ cells using FlowSOM, then trains a model on the control samples to learn how marker\
  \ \nexpression distributions differ across batches for each population.\nIt then\
  \ uses splines to align these distributions to a common reference (either a midpoint\n\
  derived from all batches or to a single batch).\n\nIn this CytoNorm version, an\
  \ aggregate of each batch is created and subsequently used as a \nproxy for the\
  \ control samples, aligning the batches to batch 1.\n\nThe number of cells used\
  \ to create an aggregate is set as the number of cells in the smallest \nsample\
  \ or 1,000,000, whichever is the smaller, multiplied by how many samples there are\
  \ in the batch.\nClustering was performed by FlowSOM.\nThe size of the SOM grid\
  \ is varied linearly between value of 6-16, with default set to 15\nfollowing the\
  \ default value provided by CytoNorm.\nThe number of metaclusters is varied linearly\
  \ between value of 8-20, with default set to 10\nfollowing the default value provided\
  \ by CytoNorm.\nThe number of cells clustered by FlowSOM is set as the number of\
  \ cells in the smallest \naggregate or 1,000,000, whichever is the smaller, multiplied\
  \ by how many batches there are in the data\n(because 1 aggregate = 1 batch).\n"

  description: "Cytometry is a non-sequencing single cell profiling technique commonly\
    \ used in clinical studies. \nIt is very sensitive to batch effects, which can\
    \ lead to biases in the interpretation of the result. \nBatch integration algorithms\
    \ are often used to mitigate this effect.\n\nIn this project, we are building\
    \ a pipeline for reproducible and continuous benchmarking \nof batch integration\
    \ algorithms for cytometry data.\nAs input, methods require cleaned and normalised\
    \ (using arc-sinh or logicle transformation)\ndata with multiple batches, cell\
    \ type labels, and biological subjects, with paired samples\nfrom a subject profiled\
    \ across multiple batches.\nThe batch integrated output must be an integrated\
    \ marker by cell matrix stored in \nAnndata format.\nAll markers in the input\
    \ data must be returned, regardless of whether they were integrated or not.\n\
    This output is then evaluated using metrics that assess how well the batch effects\n\
    were removed and how much biological signals were preserved. \n"
